This is a simple [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/game) live search tool build using their public stash tab api.
I built this project as part of a mock hackathon assignment over the course of three days using ReactJS and express.

As is the project can only search by item name, which makes it pretty much useless for anything other than 'unique' items, but it'll be just a little bit of additional work to add more search parameters when I come back to this later.

You can clone this project to your machine with `git clone https://github.com/Z4rkal/Path-of-Exile-Item-Alerts`.
You can then download the dependencies with `npm install` and then build and launch the server with `npm start`.

The server listens on port 3000, so you can access the web page it serves at `localhost:3000`.

A working example of the project is deployed on [Now](https://path-of-exile-item-alerts.zarkal.now.sh/).
