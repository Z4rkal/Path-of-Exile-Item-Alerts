### About this project:
This is a simple [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/game) live search tool that parses data from their public stash tab api.
I initially built this project as part of a mock hackathon assignment at [@SanDiegoCodeSchool](https://github.com/SanDiegoCodeSchool) over the course of three days, and that version of the project can be found on the 'hackathon' branch if you'd like to see it.

Since then I've fixed up the code and added several new features, such as additional search parameters and result sorting functionality.

A working example of the project is deployed on [Heroku](https://of-react-hackathon.herokuapp.com/), but the Heroku deploy should be thought of like a demo; if you would like to make use of this project, please clone it and run it off of your own machine.

#### Setup:
You can download this project with `git clone https://github.com/Z4rkal/Path-of-Exile-Item-Alerts`.
Then you need to enter the project folder and download the dependencies with `npm install`.
Use `npm test` to ensure that everything is working, and then if you're good to go you can use `npm start` to launch the app.

The server listens on port 3000, so you can access the web page it serves at `localhost:3000`.

#### Contributions:
I don't currently have plans for this to be anything but a fun solo thing for me to chip away at in my spare time, but feel free to clone the project and use the code as you see fit.
